# snake-game

Our snake game will comprise of 4 files:
- the SNAKE file (which defines the snake attributes and functions)
- the FOOD file (which defines the food attributes and functions)
- the SCOREBOARD file (which defines the scoreboard's attributes and functions) and
- the MAIN file (which combines the workings of all other files to make the game).

I employed python concepts such as OOP (Objected-Oriented Programming), Slicing, Tuples.
You also need to be familiar with the Turtle library.
